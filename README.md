# dogtopia-android

This was an old application I made in my free time while working at a dog daycare. The purpose of the application was to allow pet parents to watch their pets on the in-room cameras that would be live streaming during open hours.  After some work, I pitched it to corporate who turned out to be making an application already! So this was more than anything a good learning experience to get more comfortable with Kotlin and Android development.

## Features
The application itself was relatively barebones because I spent more time than anything getting the Nest cameras to display properly without any existing public API at the time. With that said, you could:
- Watch the live feed of any location (loaded from a json file containing each location and their camera URL)
- Support for multiple cameras
- See the active hours of every location
